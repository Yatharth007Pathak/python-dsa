"""
Given a binary tree, find its preorder traversal.
In preorder traversal, nodes are visited in the order of: root, left subtree, and then right subtree. 
The output from each tree is displayed in the format specified in the print statements.

Examples:

Input:
        1      
      /          
    4    
  /    \   
4       2
Output: [1, 4, 4, 2]

Input:
       6
     /   \
    3     2
     \   / 
      1 2
Output: [6, 3, 1, 2, 2] 

Input:
         8
       / \
      3   10
     / \    \
    1   6   14
       / \   /
      4   7 13
Output: [8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 10, 14, 13]

'''
Here's a line-by-line breakdown of the provided code:

Define a class Node: This class represents a single node in a binary tree.

Initialize the Node class with a value: The constructor takes a value val and assigns it to the nodeâ€™s data attribute.

Set left and right attributes to None: These attributes represent the left and right children of the node and are initially set to None.

Define a class Solution: This class will contain methods to perform operations on the binary tree.

Define the method preorder within Solution: This method takes the root of the tree as an argument and 
returns a list of values from a preorder traversal.

Initialize an empty list called result: This list will store the values of nodes visited during the traversal.

Call the helper method _preorder_helper: This method performs the actual traversal, taking the root node and the result list as arguments.

Return the result list: After the traversal is complete, return the list containing the values in preorder.

Define the helper method _preorder_helper: This method takes a node and the result list as 
arguments to perform the recursive preorder traversal.

Check if the current node is not None: If the node exists, proceed with the traversal.

Append the node's value to the result list: This marks the visit to the root node.

Recursively call _preorder_helper for the left child: This traverses the left subtree.

Recursively call _preorder_helper for the right child: This traverses the right subtree after finishing the left subtree.

Begin testing the traversal in the main block: This block runs when the script is executed directly.

Create the first tree (root1): Initialize nodes and set their left and right children to create a specific tree structure.

Instantiate the Solution class: Create an instance to use the preorder method.

Print the preorder traversal of Tree 1: Call the preorder method with root1 and display the result.

Create the second tree (root2): Initialize another tree structure with different nodes.

Print the preorder traversal of Tree 2: Call the preorder method with root2 and display the result.

Create the third tree (root3): Initialize a more complex tree structure with multiple levels.

Print the preorder traversal of Tree 3: Call the preorder method with root3 and display the result.
