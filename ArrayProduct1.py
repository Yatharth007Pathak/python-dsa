"""
Given an array arr[] containing N integers. In one step, any element of the array can either be increased or decreased by one. 
Find minimum steps required such that the product of the array elements becomes 1.

Example 1:
Input: N = 3, arr[] = {-2, 4, 0}
Output: 5
Explanation: We can change -2 to -1, 0 to -1 and 4 to 1. 
So, a total of 5 steps are required to update the elements such that the product of the final array is 1. 

Example 2:
Input: N = 3, arr[] = {-1, 1, -1} 
Output : 0
Explanation: Product of the array is already 1.

To solve this problem, the goal is to make the product of the array elements equal to 1 with the minimum number of steps. 
Each step allows you to either increase or decrease any element by 1. Hereâ€™s how you can approach the problem:

If the element is 0: Convert it to 1 because multiplying by 0 will never yield a product of 1.
If the element is negative: Convert it to -1 because multiplying by -1 can help in achieving the desired product, 
depending on the number of negative numbers.
If the element is positive and greater than 1: Convert it to 1 since 1 is the neutral element in multiplication.
Track the number of negative numbers: If there are an odd number of negative numbers after making all possible conversions,
you'll need to flip one of them to positive (i.e., make it 1 instead of -1) to ensure the product is 1.


Here's a breakdown of the code:

class Solution:
Defines a class named Solution. This class will contain methods for solving different problems.

def makeProductOne(self, arr, N):
Defines a method makeProductOne within the Solution class. 
This method takes two arguments: arr (a list of integers) and N (the number of elements in the list arr). 
The goal of this method is to determine the minimum number of steps needed to make the product of all elements in the list equal to 1.

steps = 0
Initializes a variable steps to 0. 
This variable will keep track of the total number of operations required to achieve the desired product of 1.

negative_count = 0
Initializes a variable negative_count to 0. This will count how many negative numbers are in the array.

zero_count = 0
Initializes a variable zero_count to 0. This will count how many zeros are in the array.

for i in range(N):
Starts a loop that iterates over each element in the array arr using the index i.

if arr[i] < 0:
Checks if the current element (arr[i]) is negative.

steps += (-1 - arr[i])
Converts the negative number to -1. This is done by calculating the difference between -1 and the current negative number, 
then adding that difference to steps.

negative_count += 1
Increments negative_count by 1 to keep track of how many negative numbers have been processed.

elif arr[i] > 1:
Checks if the current element (arr[i]) is greater than 1.

steps += (arr[i] - 1)
Converts the number to 1 by calculating the difference between the current number and 1, then adding that difference to steps.

elif arr[i] == 0:
Checks if the current element (arr[i]) is zero.

steps += 1
Converts the zero to 1 by adding 1 to steps (since 0 needs 1 step to become 1).

zero_count += 1
Increments zero_count by 1 to keep track of how many zeros have been processed.

if negative_count % 2 != 0 and zero_count == 0:
After the loop, checks if the count of negative numbers is odd and there are no zeros in the array. 
This is important because an odd number of negative numbers will result in a negative product, 
so an additional step is needed to convert one of the -1 values to 1.

steps += 2
Adds 2 to steps to account for converting one -1 to 1, ensuring the final product will be positive.

return steps
Returns the total number of steps required to make the product of the array elements equal to 1.

solution = Solution()
Creates an instance of the Solution class.

print(solution.makeProductOne([-2, 4, 0], 3)) # Output: 5
Calls the makeProductOne method with the array [-2, 4, 0] and N=3. The method returns 5, which is printed to the console.

print(solution.makeProductOne([-1, 1, -1], 3)) # Output: 0
Calls the makeProductOne method with the array [-1, 1, -1] and N=3. The method returns 0, which is printed to the console.
